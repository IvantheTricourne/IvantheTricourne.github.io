In the previous chapter, we introduced the foundation of FP languages, a few key concepts on types and the basis of writing recursive programs in a functional language. In this chapter, we take a little bit of all three and introduce the simplicity of writing *interpreters* in a functional language.

### 1. The Big Picture

#### a. We're Not in PureScript Anymore -- The Î»-calculus (Reprise)
#### b. No Hacks Required -- Envs, Values and Terms
<!-- interpreter goes here -->

### 2. Show Me the Data

#### a. One Does Not Simply Show Functions -- Function Representation
#### b. A Happy Medium -- Closures

### 3. Continuing with Interpreters

#### a. One Step at a Time -- Continuation Passing Style
#### b. If You Squint Your Eyes -- Tail Calls
<!-- calling in tail position -->
