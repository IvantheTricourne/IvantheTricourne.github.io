-- The (simple) Hygenic-Name Tag Generator
-- by Carl Factora

Description:

Parties are not just for having fun and enjoying food and drinks--they're also
for meeting new people! Thus, a lot of parties incorporate the use of nametags
to help ease the effort of necessary introductions between party goers. With the
help of functional (reactive) programming, we can help further simplify the
incorporation of nametags in parties by generating hygenic-name tags. With this,
every party goer is given a unique nametag designed with a particular shape to
associate with their unique identity as an individual! This also functions as a
great and novel door-prize for attending the party.
