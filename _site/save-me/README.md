My name is Carl Factora. I'm a writer, mathematician, SSBM player and
aspiring software developer.

For some reason, you've found my GitHub.io page. This is relatively new,
so it'll be a second before things get interesting here.

Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/CJF_setBaNG">twitter</a>,
if you like. If you like video games, I stream on
<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/setbang">twitch</a>.

### Stuff that's on here:
<hr>

Below are some links to some cool things (hopefully the list gets longer, but
I make no guarantees).

* **Elm Projects**:
  * [Random GIF Generator](random-gifs/index.html)
  * [Name Tag Generator](Name-Tag-Generator/index.html)
* **Other**:
  * [Recurse Stream: Functional Programming](_posts/)

### @TODO
<hr>

* Maybe start a blog (on *here*).
* Make a better landing page that doesn't just use Markdown (**LOL**).
* Add Recurse FP Stream Posts.
