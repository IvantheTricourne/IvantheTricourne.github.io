I'm currently a Software Engineer at 
[Bloomberg](https://foam.space/company).

Previously, I worked at
[Foamspace]((https://foam.space/company)
designing a decentralized proof of location protocol on the Ethereum blockchain.
Before that, I was at
[Droit](https://droit.tech/)
where I designed and maintained the core design engine, **Adept**,
which is currently used by some of the world's largest banks for their
regulatory compliance needs.

Aside from that, I play quite a bit of video games, and I sometimes
stream on 
[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/setbang).
