My name is Carl Factora. I'm a writer, mathematician, SSBM player and aspiring software developer.

For some reason, you've found my GitHub.io page. I'm probably going to use this page to host my projects to share it with whoever wants to see it. Head over to my [Projects](https://ivanthetricourne.github.io/projects/) page to see what I mean!

I'm also a bit of an FP (*functional programming*) nut, so I'll post (at least twice/week) on concepts for those who want to learn. 


### More Information
I'm doing all my stuff at [Recurse Center NYC](https://www.recurse.com/)! This makes me a *Recurser*.

I'm currently working on developing a site with a few people (mainly [this guy](https://twitter.com/lazywithclass)) that teaches FP concepts and fundamentals. This takes inspiration from the [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/), which was also written by another Recurser. We plan to use PureScript to implement a lot of the stuff on the front-end.

This is the site: [Project Î»amp](www.project-lamp.org)
