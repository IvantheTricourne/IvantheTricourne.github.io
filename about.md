My name is Carl Factora. I'm a writer, mathematician, SSBM player and aspiring software developer.

For some reason, you've found my GitHub.io page, which I'll probably use to share my projects with whoever wants to see it. Head over to my [Projects](https://ivanthetricourne.github.io/projects/) page to see what I mean!

I'm also a bit of an FP (*functional programming*) nut, so I'll post (at least twice/week) on concepts/fundamentals for those interested in learning a few things about FP.

### More Information
At least until the middle of May 2017, I'm doing all my stuff at [Recurse Center NYC](https://www.recurse.com/)! This makes me a *Recurser* and a part of an awesome community of hackers and people who love sharing their skills and knowledge with other people.

I'm currently working on developing a site with a few people (mainly [this awesome guy](https://twitter.com/lazywithclass)) that teaches FP concepts and fundamentals. This takes inspiration from the [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) online book, which was written by another Recurser. We plan to use PureScript to implement a lot of the stuff on the front-end.

This is the site: [Пroject λamp](http://project-lamp.org)
