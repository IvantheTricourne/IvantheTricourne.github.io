My name is Carl Factora. I'm a writer, mathematician, SSBM player and aspiring software developer.

You've found my GitHub.io page! I'll probably use this site to share my projects--Head over to my [Projects](https://ivanthetricourne.github.io/projects/) page to see what I mean!

### Current Information
At least until the middle of May 2017, I'm doing all my stuff at [Recurse Center NYC](https://www.recurse.com/)! This makes me a *Recurser* and a part of an awesome community of hackers who love sharing their skills and knowledge with other people.

I'm currently working on developing a site with a few people (mainly [this dude](https://twitter.com/lazywithclass)) that teaches FP concepts and fundamentals. This takes inspiration from the [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) online book, which was written by another Recurser.

This is the site: [Пroject λamp](http://project-lamp.org)
