My name is Carl Factora. I'm a writer, mathematician, SSBM player and aspiring software developer.

You've found my GitHub.io page! This site is a place for my blog and for hosting links to my projects--head over to my [Projects](https://ivanthetricourne.github.io/projects/) page to check them out.

### Current Information
At least until the middle of May 2017, I'm doing all my stuff at [Recurse Center NYC](https://www.recurse.com/)! This makes me a *Recurser* and part of an awesome community of hackers who love sharing their skills and knowledge with other people.

I'm currently working on developing a site with [this dude](https://twitter.com/lazywithclass) that teaches FP concepts and fundamentals. This takes inspiration from the *[Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)* online book, which was written by another Recurser.
