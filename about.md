I'm currently a software developer at
[Droit Financial Technologies, LLC](http://droit.tech).

I design and maintain the core design engine, **Adept**, which
is currently used by some of the world's largest banks for their
regulatory compliance needs.

Aside from that, I play quite a bit of video games, and I sometimes
[stream](https://www.twitch.tv/setbang).
