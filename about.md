I'm ~~currently~~ a _former_ software developer at
[Droit Financial Technologies, LLC](http://droit.tech).
Currently, I am a 
[_free man_](http://ivanthetricourne.github.io/free-wednesdays/).

At Droit, I designed and maintained the core design engine, **Adept**,
which is currently used by some of the world's largest banks for their
regulatory compliance needs.

Aside from that, I play quite a bit of video games, and I sometimes
[stream](https://www.twitch.tv/setbang).
