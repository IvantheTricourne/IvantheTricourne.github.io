title: work that stirs the soul.

We're back, and this time it's only been a month since I last posted on here. I've recently been doing a lot of thinking about the things I spend time on. It was only a few years ago that I was pretty set on the fact that I didn't care too much about where my time/energy went but things are quite different now. Perhaps it's part of the whole _getting older thing_.


<!-- Since the last post, my personal tournament completed 2 more iterations and is now open to the general public. Additionally, in the last 2 weeks, I've also created my first full-stack __Project Slippi application__, _Slippi Stats GUI_. -->

#### _growing a community_

<!-- 1. Summarize events with 4Skinz Sundaez -->
One of the big things happening is the continued success of my personal tournament series. My homies and I ran the 4th iteration of [_4Skinz Sundaez_](https://smash.gg/tournament/4skinz-sundaez-4/details), an online bi-weekly _Super Smash Bros. Melee_ (SSBM) tournament series. Unlike previous iterations, this was the first publicly advertised one, which resulted in a handful of new people in attendance.

While there are still a few more minor logistic concerns that need to be ironed out, the tournament ran quite smoothly and (IMO) continues to improve in every iteration. 

Some short term goals related to the series:
* Streamline the tournament process around match streaming (_Slippi spectator pls_)
* Have 16 attendees in one tourney (before the 10th iteration)
* Include some sort of big monthly tourney as part of the series

Moving forward, I also plan on advertising earlier (i.e., probably a day or 2 before) and possibly in several other discord servers to achieve more visibility on the event. Having your own tournament series is an amazing way to grow a community for playing a game you love. On top of all this, I can't forget to shout out my homies for being there to help me run things and also everyone who continues to sign up. I hope to see a lot of new faces in future tournies!

#### _growing yourself_

As I described in my [previous blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}/branching-out), I've started branching out and doing my own stuff even when it comes to programming and my "professional skillset". Doing so has really opened my eyes on how one's day-to-day can define the person you are and the person you're becoming. It's this line of thinking that has allowed me to ask myself: _What do you want to be remembered for?_ _Am I just another cog in someone else's dream?_

During the first week of October, I took an entire week off of work to give myself a break from work-related things. In all honesty, I wasn't in the right headspace during this time and found it quite hard to focus on anything. During this free time, aside from the usual rest and rec., I decided to give myself somme time to work on an entirely new set of projects. These projects are more or less related to running tournament streams and improving my Elm skills. One of this projects is an app I've been calling the _Slippi Stats Viewer_. As of right now, it's the most complex project I've ever written in Elm.

<!-- 2. Introduce Slippi Stats -->

The app is designed to present _post-set_ information in a clean and interesting way, which makes it quite useful when used on a tournament stream. As of writing, the app currently has the following key features:
* A standard set of gameplay stats for the set (i.e., _Total Damage_, _APM_)
* A set count and visual cues for the winner of the set (i.e., the center icon, gold highlight)
* Individual game stats including a count for the winner's remaining stocks
* Tracking player character/color changes

Quite a few people have already expressed great interest in the current state of this project. While, IMO, I'm still quite far from finished, my idea for the first release is nearing completion. When that happens, I will be writing more in depth blog-post about the experience I've had writing it.

This little app has already had quite a big effect on me, probably in more ways that I'm currently aware of. Doing something like this for myself and for the _community_ that is growing around something I love is truly a special, one-of-a-kind feeling. On top of all that, my girlfriend has also taken interest in helping out with some of the design aspects of the app. She provides a skilled eye in the aesthetic aspects of the app that I could not accomplish on my own. Having her on board with the things I'm doing to "find myself" makes them so much more worthwhile.

#### _hunger... grows and grows_

<!-- 3. Ambitions + Goals moving forward -->

This post has already gotten quite heavier than I originally intended, but I guess that's actually a good thing. I've already reflected on so much more meaning behind recent happenings than I originally, consciously found. While these things might currently seem fleeting or at least in some sense _brittle_, I find spending my time and exerting effort in them so much more meaningful than simply being told what to do with life. That sounds like common sense, but it's surprising how many people don't or cannot see their life bigger than part of someone else's _to-do list_.

_I am my own person._

None of the highs, none of the lows--this roller-coaster ride I never thought I'd have the privilege of riding--would be possible without the person who has stuck by my side. With her, I've grown and changed in many ways. My eyes have been opened to previously unknown delicacies, my heart pulls me to the corners of life I once willingly and sometimes fearfully left unexplored. Everything I am is unequipped to describe everything you've done and continue to do for me. 

But, in this crazy and upside world, I will journey on to find the means... as long as you're with me.
