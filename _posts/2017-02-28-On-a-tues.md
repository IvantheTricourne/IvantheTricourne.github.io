title: The Last Tuesday in February

I'm really worn out after today. I woke up relatively early, did laundry, then went over to RC to get some stuff done.

Worked more on Chapter 1 (which **STILL** isn't done), but I'm more or less happy with the achievements of the day. Alberto and I got a rough sketch of an interactive REPL for Project Lamp!! The implementation is a bit hacky, but, hey, it's just the beginning.

I was gonna work on Heroku today, but the website was down for a while, so that didn't work out at all. Perhaps tomorrow.
