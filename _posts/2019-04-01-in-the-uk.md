title: UK - the first day
---

First post not from within the US!

For the next 2 weeks, I'll be working in Droit's UK office. My goal
is to develop closer ties with the engineers here and complete the
work associated with the
[latest development sprint](https://github.com/droitfintech/nuvo/milestone/10).
The London crew seems quite welcoming. As an initial observation,
I think this is the case because I think most people here are
quite clearly _extroverted_, at least when compared to the general
populace in NY.

This is also my first time ever being in Europe. I got quite a few
warm welcomes from numerous people (even from non-coworkers). It
seems the culture around here is quite friendly to tourists (viz.
people who don't know how to make their way around). It actually
took quite a bit longer than I expected to find my way to my hotel
as the streets in downtown central London (where I'm staying and working)
are quite confusing. Really, it's quite ridiculous. _Who puts street
signs on random building facades?_ The NYC grid system is something
I apparently have taken for granted.

Aside from workie things, I'm definitely going to try to take
quite a bit of pictures. I plan to go out quite often to see the
sites, whatever that means. Admittedly, I've made 0 plans for this trip,
aand I'm only now kind of regretting it. London seems like a nice place
to explore, and it's quite large and diverse. Glad to have the chance
to be here for a while. Hopefully I can find a way to somehow calm
my nerves of being away from home and not having to deal with homely
responsibilities--perhaps then I _actually_ convince myself that I
can have a good time.

As a side note, flying business class with Norwegian air is apparently
_the only way to go_. Aside from being able to skip distrurbingly long
international flight lines (check-in and security) at JFK, I've never
been more comfortable than I was on my way here. I'm just not sure I
can convince myself to spend an extra >=$500 for creature comforts.
For a 7 hour flight... maybe it's more understandable.

Finally, I do have an upcoming blog post from last week that I'm still
working on. I've been traveling more than I usually do lately, and it's
definitely taking its toll on my motivation for these kinds of things.
I'm still working on it, but I want to give the writing/story the time
it really deserves.
