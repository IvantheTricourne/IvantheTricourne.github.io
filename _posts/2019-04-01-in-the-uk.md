title: UK - the first day
---

First post not from within the US!

For the next 2 weeks, I'll be working in Droit's UK office. My goal
is to develop closer ties with the engineers here and complete the
the work associated with the
[latest development sprint](https://github.com/droitfintech/nuvo/milestone/10).
The London crew seems quite welcoming. I think this is the case
because I think most people here are quite clearly _extroverted_,
at least when compared to the general populace in NY.

This is also my first time ever being in Europe. I got quite a few
warm welcomes from numerous people (even from non-coworkers). It
seems the culture around here is quite friendly to tourists (viz.
people who don't know how to make their way around). It actually
took quite a bit longer than I expected to find my way to my hotel
as the streets in downtown central London (where I'm staying and working)
are quite confusing. Really, they're quite ridiculous. _Who puts street
signs on random building facades?_ The NYC grid system is something
I apparently have taken for granted.

Aside from workie things, I'm definitely going to try to take
quite a bit of pictures. I plan to go out quite often to see the
sites, whatever that usually means. I've made 0 plans on this trip,
and I'm only now kind of regretting it.
