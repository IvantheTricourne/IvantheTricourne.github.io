title: Be a fighter
---

A little bit of a Sunday morning reflection.... It's funny to admit that I've learned this from playing a Fighting Game, but there is truth and value in "fighting the good fight" until the end and not simply opting to "slide by".

I would consider myself a big dreamer--I admit--I'm excessively ambitious in virtually everything I put heart to. Yet, if there's one thing I've learned in the last year, it's that one's mind should be set on "continuous progress" without dwelling on the possibility of a certain end result. That applies to everything--work, school, and whatever.

No, it's not wrong to dream--it's not wrong to aspire after things--it's not wrong to be goal driven--but those things aren't going to get you through suffering. It isn't going to get you up when you've been bruised and beaten. Inspiration is not going to be the there for you 24/7, so it's best to stop pretending that is and getting down on yourself when the sun doesn't shine quite like it did the day before.

There are so many people focused on the end result, so much so that they lose energy and the will to continue when they're downed and end up just waiting for "the fulfillment of their dreams." No. I refuse to be a part of that. There's beauty in the struggle, joy in the pressure of each moment, fulfillment in rising up again, and again, and again...

Be honest with yourself. Be a fighter. Continue.
