title: code review.
---

Spent today reviewing some work for an upcoming change to Adept. The PR
was close to 5000 lines (includes data files). This effort took most of
my morning and also part of my afternoon, but I was also (in parallel)
working on getting one of my own PRs code reviewed. Finished the day with
my work getting merged. Hoorah for less technical debt.

**Side note:**

I feel like _code review_ is a highly underrated, under appreciated part
of the work we do. Code review necessarily takes a long time, especially
for code that you _also_ tasked to maintain.
