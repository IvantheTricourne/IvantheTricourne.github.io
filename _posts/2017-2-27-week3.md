title: RC -- Week 3
---

I'm pretty happy with what I got done today despite not feeling all too well when I woke up. I basically just worked on Project Lamp and got most of Chapter 1 done (even though I told myself that I would finish it last weekend).

I also got around to planning the next few steps with Alberto. In the near future, I'm hoping to be able to understand enough of PureScript to write most (if not all) of all the framework in the language. I think that would make working on new content a bit easier than having to stumble over the HTML and JS.

This week I'm planning to learn how to use Free Monads and implement a static site in PureScript, which help with creating the necessary framework for Project Lamp.

Cheers.
