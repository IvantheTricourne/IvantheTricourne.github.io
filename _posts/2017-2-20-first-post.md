```
TL;DR/TODO...

Learned how to use some things in Jekyll
Learned how to use some PureScript
Worked on a few FP posts
```

Today, I spent a few hours learning how to configure this site. I learned that there are a few weird things that happen behind the scenes with Jekyll, but those are just somethings that I'll have to get used to/learn (beats having to actually learn how to write the proper HTML and such).

I've also given up on my ardent crusade of *never using GitHub Desktop*. So far, it's been quite the relief to actually use a GUI interface for GitHub projects. I do think I would eventually return to my old GUI-less ways once I get used to a few new things.
