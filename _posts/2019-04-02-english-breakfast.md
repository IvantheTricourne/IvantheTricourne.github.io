title: english breakfast.
---

I managed to fall asleep around 9pm last night, mainly trying to
convince myself that I didn't need to gorge myself with the copious
amount of chocolates the hotel left in my room. Woke up around 4am
(BST), so jetlag is in full swing. I also forgot to buy water last
night, so waking up before the crack of dawn was mostly just me
memeing and contemplating whether or not London tap water is a wise
choice. _Spoilers:_ it wasn't. The saving grace for my morning was
an _English breakfast_, the most enjoyable part being the fact that
it was down the street from work/hotel. Otherwise, it was pretty
bland and quite tasteless. I later learned that one should only get
an English breakfast if they make everything from scratch and freshly
made just for you.

I'm supposed to be catching up with the CEO sometime today, but he
apparently is not going to be in today. I'm not sure how that's going
to work out, so I'll probably just continue working on formalizing
docs for the new DSDS-based platform (IMO should be renamed).

### comparing NY vs. UK

Continuing with my goal of understanding the differences between NY
and UK, I'm going to try to add some minimal observations comparing
the 2. The first one today is about _meetings_.

Holy crap, London has a much better meeting/work ratio:

I love working in the morning, where I feel like I'm most productive,
but this is how a typical day in NY is:

IMO, the whole company should aspire to be _A little less Hudson, a
little more Thames_.
