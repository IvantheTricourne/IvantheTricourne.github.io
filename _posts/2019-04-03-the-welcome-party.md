I actually started writing this post quite a while ago after
just being 2 days in London. So, given that the trip a little
under 2 weeks in total, I have quite a bit more to say about
it, and a lot of the thoughts I initially had have evolved
as well. I'm sort of making it my point to write up my
experience in the best (most accurate) way possible--for my
own benefit to remember it and for others to consider.

<!-- I have quite a bit to say about the last few hours, but I, unfortunately, -->
<!-- will probably not have the most time to say it all (I also have sprint -->
<!-- related things I need to spend the majority of my time on). So, I have -->
<!-- made it my point to at least try and jot some of my thoughts down before -->
<!-- they completely melt away. There will probably be quite a few more -->
<!-- retrospective thoughts I'll write about the matter, but I'll leave those -->
<!-- for the next few days as they continue to stew in my head. _*deep breath*_ -->

To give a little bit of background, I've been working at my
current company (Droit) for almost 2 years. This was job was
also my first job, so part of my learning experience was
learning what it meant to have a job in the software industry.
Having now the experience in 2 different _job environments_
(within the same company), I have a lot of thoughts (mostly
questions) concerning the stark difference and similarities
between the 2.

A rough outline of high-level thoughts:

1. The London office has a functional work culture, during work hours and after.
2. The notion of London being lackluster/lesser is dillusional and untrue.
3. Both offices (NY and UK) should make the effort to get to know each other more.

I'll briefly touch on all these points in this post, mostly about stuff
from my initial impression and perception. I personally want to relay
this subject matter with the justice it deserves.

### work culture

![work lunch](/images/work-lunch.jpeg)

Here's the UK dev and engineering team (at least a portion of them).
We all went out for pizza today, which was quite comparable to
traditional NY slices. It comes back to something that Keith, the head
of bizdev (seen below), said to me last night: _It's the collective
small things that lead either to a good, positive working culture
or a toxic one_. Not a lot of people think that going out with your
co-workers to lunch adds up to anything. Some people might even think
of it as a bit invasive of "personal time." I can empathize with both
schools of thought. In my opinion, there's a fine line between
enforcing it and encouraging it.

This is why you need a facilitator for such things, a role that, I
believe, Keith fills in quite well for the UK office. The facilitator
should not come off as having an ulterior motive for doing it--whether
for personal reasons or otherwise. Successfully fostering a
"brotherhood" or a common ground between co-workers/team members should
have the effect of allowing people to feel empowered to be themselves,
which facilitiates a more constructive,open working environment
conducive to creativity and can be the driving force for motivating
people to get stuff done. You don't just get paid to do your work...
you _want_ to do your work. In the UK office, one's contribution is
_not_ just the work related things they are able to contribute--it's
their prescence and the effect that it has across the team.

Keith is a real homie. I actually met him for the first time when he
visited the NY office last year. I didn't make any concerted effort to
get to know him or any of the other bizdev people in the company, who
are basically all in the UK office (I'll touch on that more later). To
be frank, I also didn't do this at all--it was all him. He's a very
welcoming, down to earth chill dude to hang out with.  He told me that
if I ever choose to switch offices and needed a place to stay that he
would take care of me.I wholeheartedly regret not trying to reach out
earlier to get to him better. But you know what they say... _hindsight
is 20/20_.

### little brother complex

### empathy

We are the same team, we face similar struggles... My own understanding of
this has significantly increased my motivation to try and improve things.
What makes this slighty more complicated is that one cannot understand the
disparity between the 2 offices without having your own experience with
both. Naturally, different people will react differently, but I strongly
believe that the company should make a strong effort in making this a norm,
and not just for a select, privileged few. _Everyone should feel incentive
