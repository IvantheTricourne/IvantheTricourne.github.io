title: the spirit of competition.

Over the last weekend, I attended
[Full Bloom 5](https://smash.gg/tournament/full-bloom-5/events)
(FB5), a Super Smash Bros. major tournament hosted by
[SmashAtIUB](https://twitter.com/SmashAtIUB)
in my hometown Bloomington IN. I'll preface this post with a fair
bit of warning: _this post is probably going to be really long._
So, **TL;DR**, Smash will always have a special place in my heart,
and it was because of these guys and the local scene that I was
able to realize that.

### in a nutshell: FB5 weekend

I guess I'll start out with the weekend of FB5. FB5 is the 5th
iteration of the FB tournament series. The FB tournament series
is quite special to IUB. Something similar can be said about its
sister tournament in the fall, the _Kill Roy_ series, but FB
stands out for the IUB scene: it's Bloomington's first and only
major tournament. FB5 was no less special, despite the lower than
average turn-out of top players.

For FB5, I only played Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (SSBU or Ultimate),
which is currently the newest game in the series. I opted out of Melee
this year, since I have yet to endeavor getting fully acquainted with my
[new controller]()
I did quite a lot better than what I thought I would do, going 2-2
in pools. I knew well ahead of time that my chances of making out
of pools was _slim to none_, but, nonetheless, I went, all the way
from NYC. I am confident in saying that _I regret nothing._ I am
proud to say that I went and was able to go in the first place.

But... why?

### a personal history in smash

As I have mentioned, FB is quite special for Bloomington. I was
there when FB was finally recognized as a **major** tournament.
This was a very a big deal and quite the accomplishment by
all associated with our budding scene. I am honored to have been part
(albeit quite a bit later than others) of the early phases of the
IUB scene. The first of FB series I was able to witness was FB2.
This was only a few months after I had been introduced to the competitive
Super Smash Bros. Melee (SSBM or Melee) scene through the legendary
[SSBM Documentary]().
This makes me, in the terms of the Melee community, a _doc kid_.

**Side note:** If you havent yet seen the documentary, I highly
recommend it (especially if you have a spare 4 hours laying
around somewhere), even if you aren't necessarily interested in
playing Melee or Smash.

Prior to this, I was quite casual with Melee. I had played
often against some of my elementary school friends (who I later
found out are also part of IUB smash) but mostly played with my family
(i.e., my sisters and my cousin). As is common for many people,
beating my family and friends, I had come to the conclusion that
I was "quite good", so I eventually gave up the game because
I didn't have any real reason to continue playing. I, subconsciouly,
wanted a _real challenge_, and I simply could not find it in
Melee.

I went to other games, mostly single player games and some MMOs.
Those eventually died out as well, for similar reasons. By the
time I was in college, I mostly spent my time playing World of
Warcraft (WoW), grinding dungeons and BGs. I was subconsciouly
craving for _identity_ and fulfillment. I tried to force WoW
into that slot: I slept ~3-4 hours a night, playing WoW until
the early hours of the morning, trying to make a name for myself
in the game, to my friends or at least to myself and be proud
of my efforts enough to say "My hardwork got me to where I am".
In the end, I knew WoW wasn't doing it for me. I told myself it
was time to try something entirely different. I wanted something
to really obsess with.

At this point, I started studying Computer Science, quite a change
from studying English literature and writing poetry. At this time,
I allowed myself to become fully obsessed with CS. I could feel
and sense the realm of possibility, and this helped drive me deeper
and deeper into my obsession. This later proved to be a rather
unhealthy obsession, and I developed intense tunnel vision. I ignored
my family and friends, and I became irritable when I felt I wasn't
doing something that directly contributed to improving myself--to
me, everything else was simply a waste of time. Even when I was
doing CS related things, I was always annoyed by my own
insufficiencies. I had anxiety attacks on a regular basis, and I
found myself for often hating myself than I finding or feeling
any sense of fulfillment in what I was doing.

This mindset left a mark on my personality and mindset. In some
ways, I still feel the same person is alive in me today but to
a much lesser, more controlled degree. I owe this sentiment
greatly to my association with IUB smash and the Smash community
in general. I deeply regret not being more open/vocal about
what this community has stood for in my personal life. That's
something I hope to address here and in continuity moving forward.

### beating yourself

You ever talk to someone that said they were "quite good" at Smash?
Yeah, I was one of those people. As I said already, I thought I was
**virtually unbeatable**, and that it would only take a few games
or so for me to beat basically anyone on the face of the earth.
I had "figured the game out."

Big. Words.

Little did I know, Melee would prove to be the real challenge I've
longed and searched for all those years of gaming and projecting
my dreams and aspirations onto people and things.

To all those people that I've run over with my personality and/or
hurt along the way, I owe my deepest and sincerest apologies.
I was a selfish, immature fool, and I didn't know what the hell
I was talking about.

It was my journey into the competitive Melee scene that allowed my
ego and pride to be cut down quite a few a levels. In retrospect,
I now know this was absolutely necessary. _Beating myself_ was
always something I was quite good at, but I never really understood
what they meant or how to do it effectively until Melee came along.

It wasn't until I got invited by one of my old elementary school
friends, known as GunHaver, to play some late night Melee.
