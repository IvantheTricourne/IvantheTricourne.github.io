title: the spirit of competition.

Over the last weekend, I attended
[Full Bloom 5](https://smash.gg/tournament/full-bloom-5/events) (FB5),
a Super Smash Bros. major tournament hosted by
[SmashAtIUB](https://twitter.com/SmashAtIUB) (IUB)
in my hometown Bloomington IN. I'll preface this post with a fair
bit of warning: _this post is probably going to be really long_
and will include some of my own personal, candid thoughts on Smash.
**TL;DR**, I will forever owe a great deal of gratitude to Smash
and the community around it.

### in a nutshell: FB5 weekend

I'll start out with the weekend of FB5. FB5 is the 5th iteration
of the FB tournament series, a series quite special to IUB.
Something similar can be said about its autumn tournament, the
[_Kill Roy_](https://smash.gg/tournament/kill-roy-vol-3-ft-the-moon-pugwest-mystearica-and/details)
series, but FB stands out for the IUB scene: it's Bloomington's
first and only major tournament. In this latest iteration, FB5 was
no less special, despite the lower than average turn-out of top players.

At FB5, I only played Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (SSBU or Ultimate),
which is currently the newest game in the series. I opted out of Melee
this year, since I have yet to endeavor getting fully acquainted with my
[new controller](https://b0xx.com).
I did quite a lot better than what I thought I would do, going 2-2
in pools with my Fox. I knew well ahead of time that my chances of
making out of pools was slim to none, but, nonetheless, I attended
FB5, making my way from NYC. I made it clear in my own head that my
primary purpose there was to improve and learn a few things from
re-introducing myself to the competitive scene (i.e., FB5 is my first
tournament in ~2 years). At surface level, I thought of the trip as
a simple weekend escapade to visit family and play video games.

So, I made last minute plans, booked a flight, and packed my controller
and Switch along with everything else in a single backpack. I am confident
in saying that _I regret nothing._ I am proud to say that I was able to
go and chose to do so in the first place.

### a personal history in smash

As I have mentioned, FB is quite special for Bloomington. I was
there when FB was finally recognized as a **major** tournament.
This was a very a big deal and quite the accomplishment by
all associated with our _blooming_ scene. I am honored to have been part
(albeit quite a bit later than others) of the early phases of the
IUB scene. The first of FB series I was able to witness was FB2,
which wasn't recoginized as a tournament major by the Smash community.
This was only a few months after I had been introduced to the competitive
Super Smash Bros. Melee (SSBM or Melee) scene through the legendary
[SSBM Documentary](https://youtu.be/jX9hbbA-WP4).
This makes me, in the terms of the Melee community, a _doc kid_.
When [FB3](https://smash.gg/tournament/full-bloom-3/details) happened,
FB was finally considered a major, and our small scene was considered a
_Smash haven_ of the midwest.

**Side note:** If you havent yet seen the documentary, I highly
recommend it (especially if you have a spare 4 hours laying
around somewhere), even if you aren't necessarily interested in
playing Melee or Smash.

Prior to FB2, I was quite casual with Melee. I had played
often against some of my elementary school friends (who I later
found out are also part of IUB smash) but mostly played with family
(i.e., my sisters and cousins). As is common for many people,
beating my family and friends brought me to the conclusion that
I was "quite good", so I eventually gave up the game because
I didn't have any real reason to continue playing. I, subconsciouly,
wanted a _real challenge_, and I thought that it was not possible
to find it in Melee.

I went to other games, mostly single player games and some MMOs.
Those eventually died out as well, for similar reasons. By the
time I was in college, I mostly spent my time playing World of
Warcraft (WoW), grinding dungeons and BGs. I was subconsciously
craving for _identity_ and fulfillment. I tried to force WoW
into that slot: I only slept ~3-4 hours a night, playing WoW until
the early hours of the morning, trying to make a name for myself
in the game, to my friends or at least to myself and be proud
of my efforts enough to say "My hardwork got me to where I am".
In the end, I knew WoW wasn't doing it for me. I realized this
quite early on, but I kept trying to fight back the reality (a
habit of mine that I still can't quite let go off). Eventually,
I told myself it was time to try something entirely different. I
wanted something to really obsess with.

At this point, I started studying Computer Science, quite a change
from studying English literature and creative writing. At this time,
I allowed myself to become fully obsessed with CS. I could feel
and sense the realm of possibility, and it helped drive me deeper
and deeper into my obsession. This later proved to be a rather
unhealthy obsession. I developed intense tunnel vision. I ignored
my family and friends. I became irritable when I felt I wasn't
doing something that directly contributed to my CS career--to
me, everything else was simply a waste of time. Even when I was
doing CS related things, I was often annoyed by my own
insufficiencies. I was toxic to myself and to others. I became
an anxious person and had anxiety/panic attacks on a regular basis.
I more often found myself hating what I was doing than I finding or
feeling any sense of fulfillment. In off moment when I actually
accomplished something, I brushed it off and told myself to just
"keep moving."

This mindset left a mark on my personality and mental health. In
some ways, I still feel the same person is alive in me today,
forutnately to a much lesser extent. I owe this sentiment
greatly to my association with IUB smash and the Smash community
in general. I deeply regret not being more open/vocal about what
this community and this game has stood for in my personal life, at
least to the extent that I've felt it necessary and right. That's
something I hope to address here and in continuity moving forward.

### pride and demons

You ever talk to someone that said they were "quite good" at Smash?
Yeah, I was one of those people. As I said already, I thought I was
**virtually unbeatable**. I believed that I had "figured the game out."

Big. Words.

Little did I know, Melee would prove to be the real challenge I've
longed and searched for in all those years recklessly projecting my
dreams and aspirations onto people and things. I'll take a moment
to say, to all those people that I've run over with my personality
and/or hurt along the way, I owe my deepest and sincerest apologies.
I was a selfish, naive fool. I was too caught up with my own ego to
see how I was affecting the people and things around me. I hope that
one day, I can make ammends and show that I've changed.

Ultimately, it was my journey into the competitive Melee scene that
allowed my ego and pride to be cut down quite a few (necessary)
levels. In retrospect, I now know this was absolutely necessary.
My first 2 years into the competitive scene was rough. A lot of the
time I felt that everything I was doing, practicing and researching
the game, was leading to nothing. There was many times when I felt
like giving up and often asked myself if it was "worth my time." In
a sort of meta way, I realized that my experiences was a mirror of
life. As many have said and thought before:

_Smash is a metaphor of life._

To be even more general, competition is the spirit of life. Smash
enables that outlet for me, and everything that I've gained from
understanding that has allowed me to apply the lessons I learn in
my play in my every day endeavors and life in general.
