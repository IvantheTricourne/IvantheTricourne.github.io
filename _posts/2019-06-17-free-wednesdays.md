title: free wednesdays.
---

Quick one. It's day 3 (day 5 if you include the weekend) of being a 
_free man_. I'm planning to write something more in depth about that, 
but perhaps after a few more days of settling. It's amazing how much
more time you have to allocate to personal things when you're free
from certain former responsibilities.

I'm not much of a Facebook-er, but seeing this _life event_ after taking
on the exercise of updating my job status publicly was quite an uplifting
experience (freeing). I have a lot of things to say about my time at Droit,
but I'll leave that for another post after I've taken a few more steps in 
an opposite direction. 

For now, GGs, Droit. Today's my first of many _free wednesdays_.
