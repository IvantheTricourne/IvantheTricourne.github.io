Finally got around to fixing the old blog. Actually, to be more specific, I got around to fixing what I fixed the last time for the blog.
Seems like that's just what I think about this old thing. Nonetheless, it's something I've dragged around all these years, and expanded on too
(which simply means we're paying for it now... hi Namecheap!).

I can't say I'll stick to this writing thing to be honest. I've previously had a habit of writing in a real journal, which I've only recently
and regretably failed to keep up. Perhaps that's something that I'll pick up again. Nonetheless, things are looking up though, and quite a bit
different from where they were the last time I wrote on here. Been meaning to revisit what I want to do with this old site. Not really much of
a blogger, and the medium isn't really what I'm after with habitual writing. Perhaps something more, but that's neither here in the night I'm
writing this nor perhaps tomorrow.

_There are other adventures to be had!_
