Well, it's been a hot minute since I've last posted anything on _ye olde blog_. As per the usual, my return has primarily been sparked by lack of things to do in my personal time. Though, a lot has happened (if someone looks back at this post, you'll notice that it's written in the middle of the **COVID-19 pandemic**), I haven't exactly felt inclined to write anything about anything. Maybe I'll get back to that later, but for now... oops.

I've started running my own personal 
[_SSBM tournament series_](https://smash.gg/tournament/4skinz-sundaez-2-5)
with my buddies, the first of which was hilariously under prepared. Given that this was more or less expected, I've currently restricted the attendees to a small set of individuals (i.e., my SSBM buddies who help run the tournament), but nonetheless I learned quite a few lessons on how to properly run a tournament. Eventually, I hope to open the doors when things feel more... _prepared_. With that said, I've decided to slowly go through the list of improvements I've laid out in my head starting with adding a **set count visualization app** which is 
[hosted here]({{ site.baseurl}}/set-count-app/index.html)
in my personal IO page.

Given that most tournament sets will be streamed, it's quite good to provide a visual aid for the prospective viewer on the progress of the given set at hand. I will be adding this visualization to all future tournament streams on my 
[personal twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/setbang).

Currently, the app is quite simple (as of writing this post, only a few hours of work has gone into it). The app is written entirely in 
[Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)
and mostly using the
[`elm-ui`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/elm-ui/1.1.8/) 
library. Thus far, I've had a lot of fun writing it, and it has quickly reignited my curiosity in writing Elm stuff. For those curious, I've also left the project entirely open source. Check it out 
[here](https://github.com/IvantheTricourne/elm-set-count).
There's still quite a bit of tweaking I want to do before calling it a "finished product".

Yep. That's pretty much it for now.
