title: weathering with you
---

It was really cold today; according to a co-worker it was 9 degrees with the windchill. Today is also day 2 trying out what I will call my _triggering exercise_. It's still pretty early on in the process, so I'll save my thoughts on it for another time. Nonetheless, it's quite nice to have a routine set up to clear my mind--regardless of how short lived the feeling might be. On another note, I spent the evening with my girlfriend watching a movie: _Weathering With You_. If you're a fan of anime or good films in general, I recommend it. It's from the same dude who directed _Your Name_ (forgetting his name and for the sake of the exercise that this blog post is part of I won't let myself get distracted too much). It was a visual treat and was amazing to experience in a theatre. Go see it while it's still showing!

Some notes on the exercise:

1. I can already see where I can short cut the process (which is part of the recommendation)
2. The feeling of focus I get after doing the initial steps is quite amazing (so far)
3. I'm about to finish the book and am also finding ways I can incorporate the other parts
4. I'm starting to notice that distractions are less detrimental to my focus; I'm starting to embrace them
5. I'm embracing how I like to do things regardless of how "out of the norm" they may be; it's part of the process
6. I might start the routine in the mornings some days, some days in the evening--like today
7. It's been 17 days since I've had caffeine

That's it for now.
