title: dropping the ball.

Short post for continuity. Haven't gotten much time to spend writing stuff,
especially to the degree that I've told myself I would, but I'm holding
off on being disappointed with my initial plans falling through. Still
currently in the UK, but I'm now completely _un-jetlagged_ with the feeling
of "Oh, I really want to do this before I leave" setting in. I take this
as a good sign though, since I wasn't really expecting much or any
_attachment_ to occur--look forward to a full write up on the London
experience! London is quite great; I think I could get used to this place,
but as of right now... there are _no_ plans to leave NYC.

Here's a picture of

in his "case":

I'll leave it off with saying that I'm working on improving my process of
establishing "personal expectations", a skill that I continue to struggle
with. I feel like this primarily stems from my constant desire to improve
things, so I'm trying to address that in the short term by telling myself
to (at least more often) say "That's okay for now..." and then ~~forcing~~
encouraging
myself to move on. The aftermath of doing so is also not always _clean_
per se, and half the time I feel like I'm actually giving up on something
by trying to convince myself that something is "okay". Following this
thought, the end result is usually an argument between my inner voice and
my intuition, which generally doesn't result in many things productive
and is quite mentally taxing.

But... _that's okay for now_.
