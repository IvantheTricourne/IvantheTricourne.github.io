title: Heading into Week 6
---
It's been a while since I've blogged, but I think tonight is a good night to do it!

I've spent the last two weeks working on content for Project Lamp. After I finish my work with it this week, I hope the site will have a enough content for people to work through in a week.

By the start of next week, which is the halfway point for my batch at RC, I'll take a little break from the writing and start working on something else. I'll most likely get back to the stuff I was starting in Week 2--Free Monads. I'll hopefully get a chance to stretch out my mind, which might help me write better content for Project Lamp. Who knows!

I'm happy with the progress of things. Here's to a strong second half!
