I recently got an opportunity to visit Osaka, Japan on a company trip to
[DevCon 5](https://devcon.org/).
The conference ended just a few days ago, so now I have a few days to myself
to spend in a country I've always wanted to go to. If I really think about it,
it's quite great opportunity, so I'm grateful for it.

Not to get too sappy or anything, but being away from home or finding myself
in my places always leaves me a bit reflective. Admittedly, there's actually been
a lot of "new" in my life recently, from leaving my old job and starting a new one 
to a handful of other things that I'd like to go into much more detail later. 
Just not now. 

This is the end of a something old, the close of another chapter of life.
Just as the Osaka sun never fails to wake me up (seriously, it rises so early
and does **NOT** mess around), I'm on the move to find newer and betters things
for myself. I'm living life as I should and hope to continue to do so.

Here's a picture of the day right after 
[Typhoon Hagibis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Hagibis_(2019)).
I'm fortunate enough to have avoided being in the center of the destruction.
I wish the best to those that were. Hopefully you will find peace and resolution
in the near future.
