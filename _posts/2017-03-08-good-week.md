title: Project Lamp Framework In Place!
---
Yeah. 'nuff said.

[Project Lamp](http://project-lamp.org/) is living and looking good! Going to try and do a few clerical things today, mainly to open up getting help from other people. The process of writing content is now virtually painless (think LaTex), but I'll have to write some documentation on how to use the framework we have in place. Still, I'm rather proud of how it's come along.

Here's to finishing my goals this month! *Hype Beast!!!*
