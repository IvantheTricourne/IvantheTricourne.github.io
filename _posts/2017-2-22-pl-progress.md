title: Project Lamp is Living
---

I got to iron out a few details on *Project Lamp* (PL) with Alberto. It seems that we have already made some decent leeway into the project and look forward to presenting tomorrow at RC (**HYPE!!!**).

Not to spoil too many things, but it seems that even in the way the project is unfolding (heh), we are being led down a viable path of "teaching functional programming." It's funny how those things kind of just fall into place when you're doing this and speaks volumes on how the entire concept of FP is one beatifully unified beast.

I'm very excited to keep working on this project. I hope I'll also be able to expand to different projects once we finalize everything that needs to be done for PL.
