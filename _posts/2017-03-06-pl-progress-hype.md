title: Project Lamp Progress
---

Alberto and I successfully implemented hooks to generate large parts of *Project Lamp* content! Unfortunately, it wasn't all that seamless (as I originally thought), and I've come to the realization to the pains of using a static site generator.

Things ended up quite nicely, but there are some things that still need to be ironed out. This is just the first step to making the production of book content more intuitive and less hacky.

Hoorah.
